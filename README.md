# Data Science Fundamentals 

It's a subject of the master's degree in mathematics, based on [Harvard
Course](https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2019-CS109A/pages/syllabus.html). I
will develop the labs, homeworks and the final project here. 

The main language used is Python and the frameworks include Jupyter Notebook,
among others. I recommend: 

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

## Covered Topics 

1. Definition and motivation of Data Science. Importance of the scientific
   process, modelling and visualization of the information.
2. Python Language, Numpy and Pandas for Data Science. 
3. Web Scrapping
