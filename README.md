# Data Science Fundamentals 

It's a subject of the master's degree in mathematics, based on [Harvard
Course](https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2019-CS109A/pages/syllabus.html). I
will develop the labs, homeworks and the final project here. 

The main language used is Python and the frameworks include Jupyter Notebook,
among others. I recommend: 

``pip install -r requirements.txt``
